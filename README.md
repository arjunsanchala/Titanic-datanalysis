# Titanic-data-analysis
The project mainly focus on comparison between two classification models, Decision tree and Support vector machine, using Titanic dataset. 

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to learn how things work in two most popular algorithms for classification, Decision tree and Support vector machine. This approach includes data preprocessing, parameter optimization (pruning the decision tree and tuning the SVM) and data visualization in R studio. After comparison of both algorithms, I have written the research paper which gives detailed information about output and other findings.

## Requirements
R studio,
Titanic dataset,
Theoritical knowledge of decision tree and support vector machine,
Practical knowledge of optimization of algorithms.
